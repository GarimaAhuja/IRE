Abort Barack America !!! #tcot
So let me get this straight... I have the right to chose an abortion but not the right to vote for whomever I chose? #election2012
I'm strongly against abortion, and strongly for the legalization of gay marriage and weed. That's my political tweets for the day. #Romney
Could've just aborted it; jeesh. RT @tweetdrudge: Pregnant mom casts ballot for Obama while in labor… http://bit.ly/RHc6cs  #tcot
No, I'm not for abortion. But I am for being able to choose to do whatever the hell I want with my body #WomensRights #Obama2012 #4MoreYears
All joking aside, abortion is killing a child. I dont get how people avoid seeing that. #RomneyRyan2012
@MittRomney why u tryna stop abortions ?? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY BITCHES WILL BE PREGNANT IN MY SCHOOL ??
@BarackObama is for abortion which is why I would never give him something that is important...."My Vote". However I do pray for the guy.
@mittromney I understand you don't believe in abortion, but you do NOT have the right to choose for someone else.
We are on to abortion law in Ireland #leviathan
FYI 2 the #blacks4Romney We're not voting for #Obama b/c he is black! Maybe you fools need to actually READ up on your racist candidate smh

Would love to know how al Jazeera are covering #election2012. #swingometer
Someone tell Al Jazeera they're doing #election2012 coverage wrong. Lots of women and people of colour, less old rich white men.
Al Jazeera is predicting defeat for the imperialist infidels. Not sure which side that is. Probably covering all bases. #Election2012
Al Jazeera seems to have the best coverage, again. #election2012
Al Jazeera are 3 - 10 #anyones #election2012
Al Jazeera calls Vermont for #Obama. And totally darkens his hair. #muslimbias @ajenglish pic.twitter.com/sU6a49tv
Al Jazeera wins in best election coverage, no loops, from coverage on Planned Parenthood to Voting irregularities. #Election2012
Al Jazeera is now reporting Indiana & Kentucky going to #Romney and Vermont going to #Obama. Tune in for more: http://ow.ly/f4X91

Mr. #Obama, I'm on an Amtrak train, PDX-SEA. Why don't we have this x100 and with high-speed rail nationwide? I'd never fly again!
They should probably set up the poll locations in front of amusement parks so at least you can go on a ride after you wait in line.

Anderson Cooper is looking well. Loving the tie and the sharp suit. #election2012 #tiewatch
Anderson Cooper looking good in a suit, which is basically his job. #Election2012 #GoodJobAndy
"It is amazing how close this is," says Anderson Cooper. Your network just reported @MittRomney's own internals had him down by 5 in Ohio.
Anderson Cooper: "Every time some one says 'It's gonna be a long night.' Take a drink"...Challenge Accepted! #Election2012
It's fun to imagine Anderson Cooper muttering "thanks dickhead" every time Wolf Blitzer throws to him #election2012
Anderson Cooper: “Every time someone says ‘long night’ someone should take a drink.” #election2012
I'm really just waiting for Anderson Cooper to turn to the camera and yell, "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!". #election2012
"It is amazing how close this is." -- Anderson Cooper, wondering if anyone got that he is actually incredulous, not amazed #election2012
Not yet 6 pm and Anderson Cooper already says "it's going to be a long night" will be the most overused phrase of the night. #election2012

Watching the BBC election coverage #election2012
BBC Electoral coverage! Boom! #PoliticsGeek #election2012
BBC #Election2012 coverage: 3 old guys talking about the '60s, CNN coverage: heavy metal guitar riffs. Want something in the middle.
BBC says #election2012 is 'political popularity contest'
Why are the BBC reporters assessing the election in bars? Most peculiar. #election2012
Come on BBC #election2012 coverage! This Rankin programme is middling to poor, and I'm already sleepy.
Funny from #BBC on their new #greenscrees before the #2valg #election2012 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20206247 …
BBC has whacked out the Dimbleby. This shit is real. #Election2012
Starting the evening by watching the BBC's coverage of the election. #election2012
Watching the BBC for #election2012 results. I REALLY hope the right man wins.
Right, BBC you have my undivided attention for the next 6 hours. #election2012 pic.twitter.com/mhH9j8L8
Watching the BBC's US election coverage #excitement #election2012
I don't know how, but the BBC always manages to suck every last drop of excitement out of the #election2012 leaving a dry, tedious husk.
Watching BBC coverage (lesser of three evils alongside ITV + Sky News) + Jeremy Vine's White House situation room is amazing #election2012
I don't like this bbc hologram graph thing with the scratchy noise #election2012
the #BBC have sent enough presenters to America. I want more pointless say-nothing reports from suburban diners in Ohio. #election2012
BBC or ITV? i'll go with BBC, no adverts #election2012
Watching the #election2012 returns on the BBC. The irony is not lost on me.
Watching BBC's coverage of US election, Jeremy Vine is back on the BBC's Election holo-deck, it's gonna be a long night #election2012
BBC's Jon Sopel: "Obama workers in Richmond, Virginia, tell me turnout unbelievably high in black neighbourhoods. Poss 75-80%" #election2012
BBC reporting #Romney has written a 1,118 word victory speech - no concession version #Election2012
Might head round to the BBC's DC studio and kidnap Dimbleby. #election2012
Although it's helpful that the BBC at least know their left from their right #election2012
BBC coverage dull. Really think they should have let the Match of the Day team have a crack at it. #USElection
I'm watching the election coverage on the BBC, are they all in bars in middle America? #drunkreporters #ElectionDay2012
BBC say 70% Romney v 27% Obama in Kentucky. They should have done a MOTD2 piece and played a banjo over that announcement. #election2012
Why are our BBC reporters repeating Romney talking points which are bald-faced LIES??? #election2012
BBC currently saying #Romney needs to get wealthy, elderly, white, men to vote for him... @BarackObama needs everybody else. Says it all
The Beeb are still using that awful Election music, give me a break. #election2012
#election2012 coverage starting on BBC. Kind of wish I could be watching @maddow on NBC.
#BBC now for US 2012 election time, polls in Virginia closing in 7 minutes. Vote Obama #uselection #obama
Already the #BBC coverage feels very 20th century compared with CNN & Sky #election2012
Watching BBC coverage #election #obama
it's not the BBC coverage of elections you see Emily Maitlis with her giant ipad and Jeremy Vine with his greenscreen #election2012
Watching #BBC coverage on #Election2012. Waiting for each commentator to finish each sentence with 'they're crazy buggers'
BBC coverage is shit #election2012
Are there *any* BBC anchors or reporters who aren't in the US tonight? #election2012
BBC Newsnight's Greg Palast warned of danger that #RomneyRyan2012 might try steal the elections #vote2012 http://www.amazon.com/Billionaires-Ballot-Bandits-Election-Games/dp/1609804783/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?tag=wwwgregpala03-20 …
“ @ianssmart: I won't believe anything unless I see it on the BBC.” < Agreed - it's like a little oasis of comfort! #Obama2012
BBC reports that recent #Ohio poll gives #Obama lead of 3 points, but polls usually have a 3 point le-way, so still all to play for #US2012
BBC correspondent keeps calling the Poles tight. He'll have an uprising on his hands in Warsaw #harsh #PrayforPoland #election2012
BBC politics correspondent Jon Sopel at a bar in Virginia - could it mean something? #election2012 #swingstate
Only 8 minutes to some decent BBC radio #election2012 coverage. I mean you @BBCRadio4
BBC panel getting the excuses in early... #uselection2012 #RomneyRyan2012
BBC GOP correspondent says If GOP doesn't gain more than 57% Hispanic vote the GOP will disappear. #Election2012 #YourVote #Election
Ohhh #bbc it is not neck-a-neck and you know it. That is just sensationalist. #obama will get this.
Got BBC live streaming for #election2012 not sure how else I can watch from my laptop! Go Obama!
watching the BBC #election2012 keeps making me rethink my perfect human centipede subjects.....its now 26 people long and not stopping there
BBC situation room is brass eye esq #election2012
Enjoying the BBC "Situation Room" #election2012
I really hope this guy from the BBC who is in a bar in Cleveland talking to patrons is going to do this throughout the night #election2012
The BBC election coverage both 4 and 8 years ago was excellent. I'm up and ready to watch to the end tonight. #ElectionDay #Election2012
Love it how the BBC screen says 270 to win #USelection #Obama #Romney
Okay, BBC coverage is about to start. Quite excited, though I probably won’t tweet much- shall try and go bed at a reasonable time.
And… we’re off - #Election2012 on the BBC http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20009190 … pic.twitter.com/LgPmOZaO
The BBC just called a state for Romney before Fox News #lols #Election2012
If the bbc have sent all their reporters to the US for #election2012 who's covering our news?
Wonder if BBC will fill us in on the competitive senate and closer-than-expected gubernatorial race in Indiana? Probably not #election2012
Why are all of the BBC presenters in bars? Oh, so they can get through this like the rest of us. pissed. #election2012

@LornaCraigie15 they're just about to start on BBC, but will probably go on all night. Make sure you have a vat of strong coffee! #Obama
BBC say turnout in #Virginia is very high - could be good for #Obama
Is that man on the BBC just said that the people of Virginia can't count? #election2012
@ToasterwithWifi have #BBC called Virginia for #Romney?
Loving the fact that most of the #election2012 coverage on BBC is concerned with Virginia #homestate #gobama
BBC calling voting suppression and machines in Pennsylvania changing votes @Aquinaspolitics #election2012

Obama won Indiana in 2008 - with 2% reporting it is 60% Romney to 37% Obama, that is a big turnaround and swing #Election2012

Obama has trended a few times recently, Romney hasn't once. Due to Romey's policies being from the sixties they send letters instead. #obama

#VoteObama is trending because it's promoted. #RomneyRyan2012 is trending for real. Which side is "trying to buy the election" now? #ivoted
I like how #VoteObama and #Obama2012 is trending but Nothing about Romney is!! LMFAO!
if you was able to vote... For #Obama #Retweet if romney KILL YOURSELF
#Obama: Nearly 22 Million Twitter Followers #Romney: 1.7 Million Twitter Followers Who would you rather vote for.
Favorite for #Obama Retweet for Romney
Observation: Obama's supporters on Twitter must be more likely to reveal who they voted for than Romney's. I haven't seen 1 of the latter.
Obama has 21 million followers on twitter, Romney has 1.7... I think we know who won #Obama2012
Interesting. #Obama2012 is trending, no #Romney trending ...
#VoteObama is trending because all of Romney's supporters are actually working right now and are too busy to tweet. #RomneyRyan2012

#Obama2012 Retweet #Romney2012. Favorite it

#Obama wants to get rid of one of our amendments? right to bare arm's. now why would he wana do that for?.*
Even if Obama does win. Watch my words....HOSTILE CONGRESS. #election2012 #GOP2012 #Romney2012

It wont be a surprise to Obama that he'll probably lose it. The state holds only 11 Electoral College Votes so it's liveable #Election2012

If #Obama wins it will be with a mandate much smaller than 2008 and with a House firmly in (R) hands. Governability will suffer.

With #election2012 in progress, we can be thankful that the campaigning for the 2014 election won't begin for another two weeks.
Can't say I care but come on @BarackObama !
Everyone can tweet #Obama2012 but when I tweet my opinion people get annoyed 😂😂 still not sorry #Romney2012 🇺🇸🎉✌
I'm needing slumber. Can I leave America in your capable hands, Twitter? Make sure it goes the way it should, yes? #Obama
Finally, an issue everyone can agree with #election2012 pic.twitter.com/QUw90Hya
@MittRomney Can not wait for you to take office and help this country for the better.

Can't believe I'm watching this #election2012
Suddenly interested in America's #election2012, it just feels like when the superbowl is on... Can never be arsed to stay up and watch it
I'm praying that we can continue to mor forward with @BarackObama #wecanwinthis
So i'm a Canadian living in Europe desperately trying to stay awake to follow the American #election2012......
Can someone be like Obama won or not? Do we know yet? #election2012
Can #SocialMedia Really Boost #Election2012 Voter Turnout? http://dld.bz/bRmZB  via @mashable #DigitalVote
I wonder if there would be as many Canadians tuning in to the American election if we had hockey to watch... #Election2012 #NHL
As a Canadian citizen, I sincerely hope @BarackObama wins the election. The US elections affect the whole world & Obama is the right choice.
@PoliticsRadio One of the many Canadians listening to your coverage of the US election #neighbourstothenorth #Election2012
I wish Canadian politics were so engaging #cdnpoli #election2012
Canadians should be allowed to vote in the election that'll decide their future #canadianprobz #election @BarackObama
RT @CalebJenkins @ActiveNick [Canadians] always vote Hockey. It's a law. #Election2012 @CNN
RT @xo_cooper speaking as a Canadian, I feel like we're more worried about who's going to win this election .. #Obama2012 doe

#ImSickOf #U.S. #election2012 We're #Canadians eh?
There's lots of lovely canapés and drinks tho, if I get tired of junk food #election2012
Now for the really tough decision. There are many candidates, and fortunately, more than one can win: WHAT TO DRINK?? #Election2012
Neither candidate is perfect but we've got a choice to make regardless. #Election2012 #VoteObama
Both candidates in every election have pros & cons, but there is one that's usually plain as day that can make a difference #RomneyRyan2012
We encourage you to find out where candidates stand on issues of importance to you, go to the polls, & vote your conscience. #Election2012
Good luck to all the candidates! #election2012
Even though they have no shot, some of these 3rd party candidates have interesting ideas #Election2012
One thing is for sure...Either candidate would be better than a world ruled by Observers #fringe #Election2012
And to the candidates tonight...may the odds be ever in your favor. #election2012
Would you vote for a candidate whose full name doesn't have enough syllables to start off a haiku? Talking to you Mitt Romney #election2012
looking up the updated results in the states that both candidates need....so far Romney is winning them. #election2012
What's the candidates' stance on claims for #accidentsatwork? That's what matters to me! #election2012
#ivoted for the candidate I feel has the smallest penis! #Romney #Represent #TeamSmallPeePee
Whichever candidate restores Pluto to its rightful place as a planet gets my vote! #Election2012
#SeriousQuestion Has a candidate ever won the Presidency while losing their home state and the VP's home state? #Election2012
Thanks to all the #candidates for offering to serve the public as an elected official. #Election2012
@MittRomney my husband is 33 & never voted. Said he would when a worthwhile candidate ran! Today he voted for YOU!! #RomneyRyan2012 #VOTE
Both candidates pushed for turnout but surely it should be easier to vote. How many people in the UK would queue for 4 hours? #election2012
I forget, did either candidate mention this? #vote #election2012 http://instagr.am/p/RtRygRnThC/ 
Neither of the two candidates are a WASP. #RandomTweet #Election2012
Tonight we find out which candidate will be our president.. Kinda nervous. 😳 #Election2012

If you were playing a drinking game and the word was 'Ohio', you would be wasted after 5 minutes of coverage. #election2012 #OHIO
drinking game: every time a state wins a vote for your favored party, take a shot. #Obama
New drinking game. Any time we go to the 'situation room' on @bbcnews - do a shot. This should be good. #election2012
Drinking game: "Too close to call" - each time that phrase is said, we drink! #election2012

For me, watching the election is like watching a football game! Go team Romney! #Election2012
Waiting for the election results.Like I'm an American. #obama
This election is a test of American intelligence. #fb  #Election2012 
This election is making @LouiseCShannon + I nostalgic about our extensive one American politics module at uni...well that and the west wing!
I'm addicted to election coverage (i've been listening since 8am). I know SO many pointless facts about American politics #election2012
Nobody cares about an election until it's an American presidential one. Well, one with #obama that is.
@BarackObama best had win this election or I change my mind on wanting to be American #VoteObama!
The polls will start closing in the next 20 minutes. I hope all my American friends got out to vote and make a difference. #Election2012
Why can't our elections be like americas, its like a 6 month party any amounts of bands and celebs turn up to the conferences #Obama2012
#election2012 A new time for America #military #economy #buzzwords
Glued to the #election2012 coverage! America, make sure you vote! #Obama
Do we have have polls yet from the Americas on the election
I'm seriously worried about this election. How in the world can it even be so close??? #Election2012
Great news, polls leaning toward ROMNEY..Undecided and Independents in droves. Voting #Romney-Ryan2012. Remembering #Benghazi. Oh yeah
I've already filled out my electoral map, but don't want to tempt the wrath. So I'll keep my predictions to myself. #election2012
Polls close and my antivirus decides to update. Massive computer slowdown. #FML #election2012
This election has me nervous but I have #FAITH that God will make the right man President! (Hopefully it's #obama )

#election2012 @msnbc reports Obama team won BB game today & staff is walking around in jeans, very relaxed so there's nothing to worry about
This has to be the biggest election ever besides when #Obama first got elected!!
Re-elected #obama would push quickly for fiscal deal: party aides http://tinyurl.com/banus8v

So far the #election2012 coverage has been pretty uneventful. Although CNN do have a 'Ballot Cam' which is basically just a bloody camera.

Election update! CNN is now able to project the obvious! #election2012
Election calls already coming in with first polls closing. NBC News projects Kentucky, Indiana for #Romney and Vt. for #Obama.
#election2012 if lines are long are people in line still aloud to vote or are people cut off at 7 sharp?

REMEMBER: As long as you stand in line BEFORE the polls close -- officials HAVE to let you vote regardless of closing time. #Election2012
Elections Official: "You can only vote for one name per column." Dumb Fuck in front of me : "Which one's a column?" #Doomed #Election2012
The election will be won with Ohio need them to pull through for #Obama
Polls in Ohio close in 25 mins. Can't wait for elections results to start coming in!! #Obama

35 minutes until polls in Ohio close. #election2012
Wow this election is hinging on Ohio... Hopefully they tradin tattoo's for votes. #suckeyes #cheaters #nobama
#Election2012 Hopefully Ohio will embrace Romney's goal to make America energy independent and vote for him.

Do you know who the real winners are this #election2012? The people in battle ground states. #NoMoreAds
This election comes when there are still people in shelter. However, those in shelter shown commitment to vote. What a resilience #Obama2012

#election2012 why do I feel I know more policies of the two parties than most voters?
@BarackObama keeping track of your election campaign on the night shift all the way from Scotland # voteobama
As I consider possible outcomes for #election2012 I'm reminded of the popular movie "The Campaign." Things could be a lot worse.
Nothing like an #election2012 to illustrate how #corrupt and archaic the voting process in the United States is.

If the exit polls are accurate, (currently tied 49%-49%) the news from Virginia may not be good for Romney #election2012
The first exit polls from #Virginia are bad news from Mitt #Romney. It's a tie. He needs to win this. Might be an early night.
Exit polls have Virginia at 49-49. This is going to be even closer than was originally predicted. Ohio is a key swing state! #Election2012

from the wires. "We gave Bush 8 years to destroy America lets give Obama 8 years to rebuild it #Obama2012" #barackobama #romneyryan2012
Bush took 8 years to break it. It takes 8 years or more to fix it. & Romney doesn't pay his fair share ! #Election2012 #VoteObama
We gave Bush 8 years to destroy America lets give Obama 8 years to rebuild it! #Obama2012 #CNN #VoteObama #ObamaBiden2012 #election2012
Bush screwed the economy and mow everyone blames it on the black dude.. #NotCool #GiveHimASecondChance #Obama2012 #OBAMAFORPRESIDENT
It took the disaster of George Bush to elect the first black president, let's not have the regret of Romney to appreciate him #Obama
When Bush was elected we moved to Istanbul, if Romney wins and California doesn't secede, will Buenos Aires embrace me? #Election2012
Did Bush accidentally vote for Obama? Not quite http://on-msn.com/RHeTTd  #election2012
#Bush a voté par erreur pour #Obama http://dailycurrant.com/2012/11/06/george-bush-accidently-votes-obama/ … / hahaha pourquoi ça ne m'étonne pas?!
@MittRomney You are nothing but George Bush w/o the laughable stupidity to cover up the evil. We're not going back to that.
In 2000, Dubya won by 548 votes in Florida. Yes, just 548. Surreal. #VOTE #Obama
America gave Bush 8 years to fuck things up, give Obama 8 years to fix things. #VoteObama #Obama2012
We gave Bush 8 years to fuck up this country now give Obama 4 more to fix this country and put us back to the way things were #Obama2012 💚❤
Remember Bush apologized to the heads of the G8 for the economic crisis originating in the US, but he didn't apologize to you. #p1 #p2 #gop
Alas, Bush tale is a hoax. Still, good one! #Election2012
Past 10 years been in the news (bush) is because he's been a fucking idiot. "deadly weapons" my ass. #Obama2012
Bush sta reclamando il premio Nobel per la Pace, visto che al contrario di Obama non ha ucciso Bin Laden ! #Obama #Bush
We gave Bush 8 years to ruin America, why not let #Obama have 8 years to fix it.
@StargazerBlake @BarackObama there is a reaon why BUSH dumb tale isn't campaigning for Romney because he was worst president in history
Bush guy. IGNORE. RT @stephanie11028: @RagCon @stephanie11028 freaked out. Karl Rove has now downgraded R's EV votes from over 300 to 285.
Good thing Bush never finished his border fence. Because if #Romney wins, people will be wanting out, not in. #p2 #p21
Does America really need another Bush? #Romney = #Bush
After bush messed up America completely... Obama picked the pieces..With the Obama care, the killing of bin laden.. And many more #Obama2012
Lets be honest if they elect George Bush to be the president...I don't think they are very scared of voting for @MittRomney #election2012
george bush RT @Johnnyzaztec: @Me four more years of what a "change for the worst Broken promises and lies over four dead Americans in libya
@john_mcguirk blaming @BarackObama for #Dubya's policies #laughable #vinb
Think america forgets how badly bush/republicans left the country in, Obama inherited that mess, its goin to take time to sort it out #Obama
IF IT TOOK BUSH 8YEARS TO FUCK THIS SHIT UP ITS GONNA TAKE OBAMA 8YEARS TO FIX IT UP. #FuckRomney #Obama2012
Our country will go back to how bad it was when Bush was in office if Obama doesn't win tonight. Go Obama! #election2012
Bush had 8yrs in office to wreck America. The ppl of this country can't give @BarackObama 8 years to fix it? 4 yrs is NOT enough time!
" @FollowMeOBAMA: We gave Bush 8 years to destroy America, let's give Obama 8 years to rebuild it! #Obama2012" Obama already destroyed it...
" @FollowMeOBAMA: We gave Bush 8 years to destroy America, let's give Obama 8 years to rebuild it! #Obama2012"
“ @FollowMeOBAMA: We gave Bush 8 years to destroy America, let's give Obama 8 years to rebuild it! #Obama2012” how bout no
“@ /FollowMeOBAMA: We gave Bush 8 years to destroy America, let's give Obama 8 years to rebuild it! #Obama2012” bush did NOT destroy USA
It took 8 years for bush to mess USA up so that's why I voted for @BarackObama he deserves 8 years to fix it. #Obama
Bush destroyed us in 8 years,you can't expect 8 years to be fixed in 4. #FORWARD #Obama
George #Bush Accidently Votes For #Obama http://bit.ly/RDBYHM  #USA #Crawford #GOP
it took #GeorgeBush 8 years to get us where we were when #Obama took over in 2008 #deficit & #war

Lets just get the hashtags outta the way: #IVoted #TeamObama in the #Election2012, and you should #VoteObama because #ImSickOf #Romney.
@Jennafnc @twitter not playing fair with #hashtags. #Benghazi & #7hoursofhell are BLOCKED. That really distorts the real conversation. #tcot
I'll be changing my hashtags regarding the election based on what's currently trending. #followtheherd #election2012
Has tag #hastag hash tag #hashtag poundvag? #vag? #obama #romney #election #nipple #blacks #1488311 #myboyadolf #nobama #sandy #imallwet #up
@rolderik what hashtag are we using tonight? #Election2012 #elections2012 #Forward2012 #ElectionDay2012 #toomany
#Election2012 is a silly hashtag. Is anybody going to think I'm talking about 1876? #election
My official hashtag for #Election2012 is #OMitt. Because I want to OMIT him from my country.
My thing just sent the hashtag #RedLobster instead of #RomenyRyan2012 Awkward...
With Americans flocking to use the #ivoted hashtag, how important is social media for candidates? http://us2012.bujournalism.info/entry/social-media-does-likes-mean-votes/ … #Election2012 #US2012
So the VoteObama hashtag is trending #1 because it was "promoted." #RomneyRyan2012 is trending #2 without having had to pay for it. A sign?
Following the #Election2012 hashtag tonight on #Twitter's special interface - http://ow.ly/f4X8X 
C'mon, I know more of you voted! Let me know you voted, AND use hashtag #ivoted. I'll retweet as many of your replies as I can today. #p2
Hashtags we're following so far: #WiVote #election2012
At 6pm, we'll convene a #metanewsroom with @towcenter & @columbiajourn for #Election2012. Use the hashtag & follow at http://bit.ly/HiGTJ2 
@SeanMcP @p_mcpartlin is that the hash tag?

How can you hate politics when it influences basically every part of your life ? #idontunderstand #geteducated #election2012
You can't hate someone for there political views. You might disagree. It's what you believe in. #Election2012
Hate to get political on twitter, but just this once........ #Obama2012
Hate republicans. Come on #Obama!!!!
I hate going to bed not knowing who won the presidency but there's a good chance by the time I wake up, we still won't know! #election2012
I hate that I couldn't vote bc I moved to California. Remember friends, #RomneyRyan2012
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I THINK IT'S GOIN TO BE A CLOSE RACE!!!!!!!! But overall #OBAMA GOT IT!!!!!!!
If you hate women, the middle class, science, the environment, immigrants, gays, peace with Iran, and dogs, Romney’s your man. #Obama2012
Come on America, prove the haters wrong. #Obama2012
Hate being hungry in bed, trying to sleep whilst munching on a mars and thinking about the world ending if romney gets elected #OBAMA
I'd hate to be the person who been forced to write the concession speech for either candidate #Election2012
Nothing divides people and brings out the hate like a Presidential election. Ugh. I dislike ignorance & bigotry so much. #election2012
I hate having to wait for the results...feeling anxious #Romney
I hate that aspects of MY future reside in the American people. #election2012
If you're hating on other people's beliefs/views, you're obviously not even mature enough to have a place in this discussion. #election2012
" @NaimHanifah33: Hate him or love him he's your next president! #Obama2012"

Vabbè, io me ne vado a letto. Ciao #Romney, ciao #Obama. Tanto il prode #Vespa veglia su di voi. A posto siamo. P.s. Forward! #Obama2012

Very impressed to see the resources @SkyNews are dedicating to coverage of #election2012 especially the IPad application. Groundbreaking
This much better @gatsdee for ipad RT @markdubya: Your full-screen dashboard for #Election2012 results as they come in: http://usat.ly/SLD447 
Keeping a close eye on #election2012 via @cnn app on #iPad excellent coverage and break down of what's happening.
Emily has the world's biggest ipad. #election2012
Why doesn't everyone have an iPhone? @BarackObama should have included that in his campaign! #ObamaPhone lol
My iphone is going to die. This is tragic. How am I going to be able to Tweet about a Romney win!?
Dropped my iphone in line for voting, if Obama wins maybe I can apply for a free one. #butseriously #Election2012
My iPhone is going to be working tonight. Gonna need the charger soon #election2012
Is there an app to give me instant election updates #Obama2012 #vote #election
Switched to a new iPhone case today. Out w/ the old in w/ the new. Hopefully my phone isnt the only instance of this tonight #RomneyRyan2012
My iphone is charged and ready for the tweets #election2012
I miss the giant iPhone from the 2010 election (but then a giant mini iPad was the obvious next step) #bbc #election2012
IF YALL CAN CAMP FOR A IPHONE, VIDEO GAME, OR SOME DAMM JORDANS YOU CAN GO STAND IN A LINE TO GO VOTE #OBAMA2012 #FUCKROMNEY
iPhone investment is paying up right now while in line to vote. #election2012
“ @gabe_grey: I finally gots my iPhone 5!” finally! Figured my stress today was about #election2012 but realized it was about of your 📱5!
Staying up as late as possible for #Election2012 but I remember this time 4 years ago I woke up at 8am with my iPhone adhered to my cheek.

MSNBC has Mitt Romney at 19 electoral votes, Pres. Obama at 3. #Election2012
#MSNBC projects that #Romney wins in Indiana
#msnbc2012 just projected Romney as winner for Indiana. Lets hope #Obama gets to the magic number first.

#Romney's feeling confident. He has written a 1,118-word victory speech - and that's the only speech he's written. #AmericaDecides2012
Romney can go suck dick, because that's what he's good at doing #obama2012
I'd like to extend a warm welcome to all women of the US: if Romney wins, please join us in more feminist Britain. #election2012 (1/2)

Mitt Romney would be the first president who was too scared to say anything when Rush Limbaugh called your wife a slut #election2012
As expected, Romney draws first blood winning Indiana and Kentucky (19 electoral votes); Obama, Vermont (3) #election2012
Reason for #Obama: when Romney was in a plane, the oxygen masks were released and he questioned why they didn't just open the windows..
I'm livin in a romney lovin house hold #romneyryan2012

Hello fellow followers. I just Voted Romney/Ryan. I feel great. Now just anxiously watching Fox news to see returns.
Super duper don't want to wake up and learn that Mitt Romney is the next leader of the Free World #Obama
If #Romney wins, that will be another step towards the apocalypse . #VoteObama #Obama2012
If Romney wins, will dems finally admit that they've been giving voters far too much credit as critical thinkers?
Romney will be another Bush #fact #election2012
If Romney wins there will be an uprising of radical feminists. Vote equality. Vote Obama #decision2012 #Obama2012
Awful feeling #Romney will be president tomorrow. #voteObama
#RomneyRyan2012 To @CNN- your #mediabias will not work, you committed ratings suicide, #propaganda journalism no more! #tcot
#RomneyRyan2012 To @MSNBC- your #mediabias will not work, you committed ratings suicide, #propaganda journalism no more! #tcot
Mitt Romney will probably try to bring back slavery and try to ban beer. Think about that when you vote. #obama #romney #2012
Really hope #romney does not take over for sure there will be a world war he wants to finish wat that cocksucker #bush started #VoteObama

" @Laughbook: If Romney gets elected I hope Kanye interrupts his acceptance speech and talks about how Obama should have won." #Obama
If Romney gets elected I hope Kanye interrupts his acceptance speech & talks all about how Obama should have won. #RNS #Obama2012
#Romney only has one speech written... his acceptance speech!! cocky fucker!!! #OBAMA
Mitt already wrote his acceptance speech huh. #obama
What a way to bow out if he loses: "Uhhh". RT @AJELive: #Romney says he's only written a victory speech: http://aje.me/U7FirF  #election2012
Romney: no campaign is perfect..doesn't feel tired after all the campaigning...and has written his 1,118word acceptance speech #election2012
I like #Romney's outlook he believes he will win, he has one speech prepared only (the winners speech?)and believes in himself #election2012
"Romney tells reporters he's written a 1,118-word acceptance speech. He says he's only written an acceptance speech." #election2012
“ @GregMilamSky: Romney tells reporters he has only written one speech for tonight #election2012” And it's a Bluey.
@AP #Romney should write his conceding speech. Only three words will do.. "I am sorry". Go @Obama.
Mitt Romney says he has only one speech written for tonight: His Acceptance Speech! #RomneyRyan2012
#Romney has written his victory speech! USA get out and VOTE. #voteobama #Forward

Dear Romney, on behalf of America, f**k you... I approved this message. #Obama2012 #TeamObama
If romney wins thats really effed up.. #obama2012
@MittRomney was NEVER WORTHY to run against #PresidentObama! #Romney was an intellectual lightweight & compensated by LYING & CHEATING!
If #Romney is the future president of the #USA I think that 21 December 2012 should really be the end of the world.
At this point I reckon #Romney is making Ryan dress up in a gimp outfit,&he's corndogging him in front of Ann, just to pass the time. #Ohio

We sure hope #Romney fans love Bush policies, that's what they'll get if he wins. Protect UR 401K now as in withdraw and dump UR stocks
If Romney wins its gonna be like when Bush was president all over again -___\ ; & I'm gonna move too if Romney ugly old send wins! #Obama
Romney is bush re-incarnated #election2012
If Romney wins this election, you'll be sorry you supported him. He's gonna be another George Bush. Making our country worse!

If Romney wins, someone better commit a "Kennedy"! #Obama2012
Obama v. Romney vs. Obama v. McCain is interesting, but - Romney is different from McCain, and #Obama2012 is completely diff from Obama 08.
Romney up 57-42% w/ those older than 65, per EARLY exits.McCain carried them 53-45%. Also, 65+ are 19% of electorate,16% in 08 #election2012
. mitt romney about to feel how john mccain felt in 2008 , >> #shitty ! lmao cause uh #obama got this .
Romney borrowing from McCain 2008 playbook & making late push for PA. Note: Didn't work then for McCain & it's not going to work now.
If Romney wins, I think McCain gets to hold at least one American as a POW. #Election2012

Romney went for two in Kentucky. #Election2012
#Romney was only up early in some of these states because all of the #Obama supporters gettin off work! #WatchThemNumbersWork #MiddleClass
Romney is leading so far but is wining in expected states and Obama wins Vermont :) #Election2012
I love how #Romney is having this huge party in a state he will loose. #Obama2012
Mitt Romney only has 39% of his own state's vote... That says something. #Obama
Romney leads so far by one state / sixteen electoral college votes #US2012 #election2012
Its pretty sad when Romney's state where he was Governor at is wanting Obama to win. #Obama2012
Romney is losing in his own state he governed in..if his own state dosnt want him then why should the nation? #Obama
How is Mitt going to be losing in the state he governed, thats saying something people. and stop posting pics of your ballots!! #Obama2012
WARNING: #Romney's State victories will come in early.... don't panic. His States are smaller & will have clearer margin (easier to call).
If Romney wins my state, then the election, I might come back to the U.S. in for years, but never back to VA. #Obama #Obama2012 #Forward
#Romney is stealing the states
Mitt Romney is such a "uniter" -- his own state he governed is voting against him. VOTE #Obama2012! #election2012
I've gotten the Romney call 3 times today like can you not. #Obama #MURIKA

Just the way #mittromney presents himself as a person is bad. He is arrogant, disrespectful and belittling. #FUCKOFF #Obama2012
Standing in a line of about 300 people in Florida making our vote count! #Obama2012 @BarackObama
Today, millions of people will vote for @MittRomney, essentially calling themselves idiots. Be kind to them. It's not their best day.
So many people giving grief to Romney, any of you know what his policies are or do you just dislike him?

People should pay taxes proportionate to their salary. If Obama is re-elected, that will happen. #Obama2012 #MoveForward
Am I the only person who's heart started pounding when it came time to vote for #obama ? Such an empowering feeling
People think because it's the news it must be the truth. Just like the same people believe #Romney tells the truth.. What a shame.
You people who think you know politics, you realize Obama inherited a shit hole because of a Republican, right? #Obama
People smoke when they're stressed right, I might need one tonight... #election2012 #NoNotReally

@MittRomney what kind of things do you have?When I find out dont expect me to stop.I come for the Ps that stack clear ur house on the spot
4 years ago the psychic Sylvia Brown said #Obama would do 8 years so you can look me in my face & see I ain't got no worries. #Election2012
Are you psychic? Say yes. Say yes. “ @iJesseWilliams: Again, I Guarantee President @BarackObama will be re-elected by the American voters.”
Psychic on the news just said @BarackObama is going to win, let's see if he's right...
Running one last projection based on this AM's polls. Our projected margin in Florida now Obama 49.797, Romney 49.775.
Latest projection has Romney at 62%! #RomneyRyan2012
Projected Electoral Gains: @BarackObama: 3 electoral votes / @MittRomney: 19 electoral votes. #Election2012
Let the projecting begin! http://is.gd/nMshN9  #GetGlue #election2012
It's 7pm, do you know where your projected numbers are? #election2012
Projecting winners based on swing state formula when people still voting, and calling a state when 36 votes are in is lame. #Election2012
It's almost "Projection Time" !!1 #Election2012
Projection: @BarackObama wins Vermont. 3 Electoral Votes!
Projections give Wolf Blitzer erections. #Election2012

Pundits on BBC saying the #election2012 is “too close to call”. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU AMERICA?? Why is Romney even in this??
Now pundits on #CNN saying that #Romney's misleading Jeep ad in Ohio could backfire. The wisdom comes aftr leak that his internal poll is -5
America's Electiongasm is about to burst. Let the punditry begin as the polls start to close back east. #election2012
Bizarre pundits. #Romney may have lost Ohio, still looks like win .... #Vote2012 #Vota2012 #Election2012
Turn out is everything - forget the pundits, ignore the polls, and get out and vote! #RomneyRyan2012
Pundit on #election2012 stated that the Republican party will be dead in the next 18 years if they don't make in-roads into the Latino vote!
Don't let the pundits and MSM's analysts discourage you...the enthusiasm is coming from our side and we will be victorious... #RomneyRyan2012
More for pundit #tcot unskewers RT @nycsouthpaw: I sorta suspect this election will mainly be remembered for making Nate Silver so famous.
Pundits: remember the word 'unanimous' means "characterized by or showing complete agreement." That's 100%. Not 91%. #Election2012 @msnbc
Pundits think that losing or winning an election is a matter of opinion. Mhmm, no it's not #election2012
Just sitting here watching the pundits begin to hedge. Always fun watching the CYA. #election2012
Just saw this. "If Romney wins there'll be 4 great years of punk rock." Always look on the bright side of life! #election2012

Saddest part of the pathetic, racist, lying #Romney campaign was realizing that McCain was right: he would have been a worse pick than Palin
It's also very sad that race is such a point of discussion. A person's ethnicity should not dictate their politics. #election2012

I don't see how you can hate from the outside of the White House, you can't even get in #Romney
Don't have to have your ID to vote in Colorado #election2012
I don't even want to imagine a world where Mitt Romney is President of the United States #Obama2012
@HuffingtonPost @HuffPostMedia Hi! Don't miss our live feed of Instagram photos from the election. http://worldc.am/election2012/  #Election2012
I truly-honestly don't get the judgement of people voting 4 @MittRomney -I mean, the guy seems to have a multiple personality disorder #FEMA
We don't claim you. Shut up RT @REALStaceyDash: Vote Vote Vote @MittRomney @RepPaulRyan #blacks4Romney #RomneyRyan2012 #Vote2012 #VOTE
I don't pretend to be fully clued up on american politics, but I think its quite clear that 'president romney' would be a mistake #Obama2012
Don't let the media and Hollywood dictate your vote. Decide for yourself #Election2012
i don't know how a woman can vote for a man who wants to control a womans body #obama2012

Come on America! We don't want mitt romney in office! Obama for life <3 #Election2012 #obama2012
Don't know how Romney increased during the debates he was awful! #Election2012
I don't mean to change your vote... But Romney said your mum was a slag! #VoteForObama #Obama2012
It's not that I don't like #Romney it's that what he says don't make sense, also he has not said anything bout helping the poor...
I really don't see Mitt Romney winning #us2012 #election2012 #uselection

I don't know if people will make the right decision or the ROM decision. #Obama2012
I don't understand politics but Obama seems cool and he took down Bin Laden.. sooo i hope he wins! #Obama2012
No I usually don't care about politics, but if one of the candidates wants to break Hispanic families apart then yes I do care. #Obama2012
I don't like either Presidential candidates but I pray that the one with better morals wins. Abortion shouldnt be legal. No excuses. #Romney
Don't be racist , vote #Obama
I don't believe in the Republican party or the Democratic party. I just believe in parties. #Election2012

Do you think Social Media has any influence on #Election2012 ? #gjco #covote
Social media 'bout to be off the chain, y'all. #Election2012
And following social media here at @itvnews room @romillyweeks and at the US embassy in london @emmamurphyitv and @alstewitn has live guests
It's amazing how much social media has been a part of this election. Definitely different than 2008. #election2012
No more social media after 6pm. My time is better spent watching V for Vendetta & eating tacos w/ the boy I love. Good luck #Obama.

Dear @Twitter, I hope you've fixed your over-capacity settings. Social media will be exploding tonight. #election2012
Don't go to social media sites to decide who to vote for. Do some research and make your OWN decision! #Election2012
If you down w the cause make it trend #Obama2012 !
This actually makes sense, cause its big enough to get its own vote RT @Isamariee_: Yer my booty went & voted #Obama2012
#MyVoteCounts cause I voted! #OBAMA
I think I'll stay off social networks until AFTER they've announced President @BarackObama has won a second term.
#SocialNetworkingAnalysis in #ATL reveals people mad at long lines, the Bush years & people taking pictures of their ballot!? #election2012

22% of registered voters have let others know how they voted on a social networking site. http://bit.ly/REifaZ  #election2012

Proud too say my state stands with the future president. @MittRomney
I just voted for @BarackObama because I believe in some gov't regulation, am creeped by Mitt Romney, and won't make $250k for a LONG time.
All the states that thought it was just dandy to own human beings are voting 4 @MittRomney & Rs, the Party that creates HALF the jobs Ds do
If I lived in the states I know who I would be voting for! #obama2012 #Vote2012

yall have 32 more minutes if you haven't voted GO VOTE if you know someone who hasn't voted TAKE THEM to GO VOTE..its your future #Obama2012
I heard there's some kind of presidential thing going on tonight. Anyone know anything about it. Who's @BarackObama and @Mittromney
I know no one will admit this, but I suspect there are many young voters (twenties/early thirties) who simply sat this one out.
“@RepPaulRyan2012: Let me rephrase, WHO IS READY TO FIRE @BarackObama TONIGHT?” The whole planet, no one wants 4 more years of him
Who's voting today? If you're not, or need some inspiration... I found just the thing #election2012 http://youtu.be/hjTp5cytIEc  via @youtube
" @autumnthebrute: Can I please just find out who won so I can actually go to sleep tonight? #OBAMA2012" pretty much.
America, please vote. I wanna know who wins TONIGHT. Not like Friday. Doesn't everyone want to start celebrating? #election2012
I can already point some fingers at who's fault it'll be when #Obama loses -_-
30 minutes until we start to see who will be leading our nation for the next 4 years #RomneyRyan2012
Staying up tonight to see who wins. #RomneyRyan2012
Stop asking who people voted for! #election2012
Who trying to match if #Obama win or lose....
I voted for @BarackObama because I believe in what he stands for, someone who understands the struggle and wont quit not because he's black.
Everybody who hasn't voted you have two more hours! #OBAMA2012 🇺🇸

We need to win #Virginia #Obama !!!!!
@YellinCNN " @mittromney needs to win VA" #cnn @cnn @wolfblitzer
WE-----> @BarackObama have to win Virginia! #CrossingFingers
Obama needs to win Virginia & then it's a most definite win for him. #OBAMA2012
Regardless of who we want to win this election, my only hope (& expectation) is a very high voter turnout throughout the U.S. #Election2012
Obama spent $760m to win 69.5m votes in 2008: $10.94 a vote. Abramovich spent £1.22bn to get 673 PL points 2003-11 (£1.8m each). Best deal?
Genuinely want @BarackObama to win the election.. This is coming from a simple welsh boy! #greatleader deserves to stay in the #whitehouse

@dp1489 good thing I have a staff meeting, otherwise my eyes would be glued to all of these polls! #Election2012
Only thing I can think of -- @MittRomney trying to GOTV at 11th hour with some urgency/fear of big Obama win. Prob necessary if #s r right
The only thing I'm going to say about the election is this: Romney's Final Four bracket wouldn't be nearly as good as @BarackObama 's.
STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD“ @FollowMeOBAMA: We gave Bush 8 years to destroy America, let's give Obama 8 years to rebuild it! #Obama2012”

If you only care about the rich and dnt give two fucks about the poor then its no way in hell you should be president
With @MittRomney you get a wealth creator & a turnaround. With Barack Obama you get a community organizer & a lecture!”
@MahanAbbey the rich want Obama so they get more money..
Why doesn't the 'wealthy backers' of the #election2012 parties give that money to starving kids? Or perhaps to prop up the economy?

Wolf Blitzer at #cnn: - Still very early. And some people say studio ahead of a FootballGame is too long.
I've heard Wolf Blitzer gives amazing electoral stimulation. #cnn #election2012
Wolf Blitzer needs english subtitles after he talks just like Honey Boo Boo and her mom. #election2012 #CNN
Wolf Blitzer says exit poll numbers in Virginia 49to49% and then says "you don't get much closer than that" Jeeze thanks Wolf #election2012

Wolf Blitzer looks a wee bit like hipster Ariel tonight. #election2012
BUT WHAT DOES WOLF BLITZER THINK!? TELL ME NOW, WOLF. #election2012
"GET READY, RIGHT NOW." wolf blitzer is not only a master of politics--he's a master of drama. #election2012
Well, here goes! I'm glad Wolf Blitzer has announced they're waiting on real results to call anything. #election2012

@VickyWicky20 Have you been drinking??
Americans have been through worse than @BarackObama. He may see a people foolish and greedy; I see brilliance. We will win in the end.

Watching live coverage for #Election2012 and slightly freaking out.
The bsdwire #DC crew watching #Election2012 coverage! Lets go! #4MoreYears http://instagr.am/p/RtN_GVGpSb/ 
Surprisingly up for watching the election but it goes on sooooo late #OBAMA
Watching @BBCNews for #election2012 coverage. As good as it always is, but I'm 4 years older! To stay up or not to stay up...
Watching #election2012 on @SkyNews! Hopefully it won't keep me awake too late.
Watching the @CNN Projections & I'm NOT liking these numbers. #Romney on top
While you're watching #Election2012 coverage tonight, make sure the lights in other rooms are turned off. Saves energy! http://ow.ly/f4zcq 
Watching the popular votes trickle in is killing me. #obama2012 #fourmoreyears #fuckmittromney
@MittRomney and @paulryan wear northface #icanrelate

@LarryPDonnelly wearing a blue tie...now there's a surprise! #election2012
Weighing in on #election2012 ready for some numbers
first quarter of school went by fast, why all of a sudden is it going by sooooo slow now...
Where were you four years (and two days ) ago? #election2012
So hopefully were all on the same page and agree that we can't afford 4 more years !!! #RomneyRyan2012
At least 35-40 pizzas were delivered to the newsroom! You know it's going to be a long night! #Election2012 #PartyLikeAJournalist
watch were your going Jeremy your going to bump into floating suff #election2012 #electionmatrix
. @andersoncooper says “We’re going to have a long night” will be most overused phrase. I say it will be “key demographic.” #election
@BarackObama were rooting for you, thank you for all your support with hurricane sandy :)
Either way, were screwed for quite a few more years. #Election2012
just in case you were starting to feel an absence of clusterfuckery in your life... http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/11/06/164408114/voting-issues-long-lines-in-florida-confusion-in-new-jersey … #fb #election2012

So apprehensive about a Romney win I can hardly bear to watch - but I will.
If Obama dosent win im ganna be so mad. #Obama2012
If #obama win we getting live alllllllllll night at the #bpg party
" @Baybee_Patton: IF #Romney WIN IM NOT GOING TO SKL"
If Obama doesn't win then I'm really gonna think our votes don't count cause it looks like our generation is MOSTLY #OBAMA ❤🇺🇸
Very nervous that #Romney might win. Could have a serious effect on the rest of the world. #worldwar3 #USElection
@MittRomney if you win I'm killing myself
#ThingsOnlyLosersSay RT @MittRomney: You win some, you lose some...
U back homie RT @RomeoNEdwards: Win or lose I #Salute @BarackObama
If you're not sure why @BarackObama should win, read @realDonaldTrump. Reaaaalllly wish they'd let me vote.
If @BarackObama doesn't win this election I will happily shave every hair on my body in order to look as ridiculous as America should feel!
@BarackObama you must WIN! #winning #Vote2012
@BarackObama he must winn
#obama #winning #4moreyears #votedforhimtwice http://instagr.am/p/RtSM62teYU/

One guarantee no matter who wins... I'll be drunk later tonight. #Election2012
If #Obama wins I'm buying bottles tonite at the club
No matter who wins today...I feel like shit will go down. #Election2012
If #romney wins then im going to be #devastated..
Fellow Americans: whoever wins, you're not going to leave the country. Let's not go straight to the hysterics this year. #election2012
If #Obama wins, I only have one thing to say: Make my vote count. Do what needs to be done...
Whoever wins I just hope they do their job for our country. #Election2012 🙏
" @imru2727: It doesn't matter who wins the #election2012 to me because I'm todays reel winner! @ReelBigFish is following me!" - well done!!
Who ever wins...we all lose. #election2012
@BarackObama @mittromney whoever wins we all still lose because you both don't have a real plan. But one of you I did vote for.
If #Romney wins, will some lovely #norniron man marry me so I don't have to go home?
@BarackObama @MittRomney I wish the best of luck to both of you.
I wish I could be drinking while watching the #electoralvote count go up and up for #Romney
Wish I could've voted #Hoping #praying #Obama2012

If I'm this nervous I wonder how @MichelleObama & @BarackObama feel?!
Wonder how awkward it must be for @crowleyCNN to be @MittRomney HQ. She is prob not their honored guest.
I wonder did the 47% vote for @MittRomney ??????
Pretty remarkable #election2012 facts... ever wonder what would happen if it ended it tie?! http://v.iheart.com/wDiG 
I wonder what @BarackObama has been doing all day ,
Wonder if Obama has packed his shit up or knows he aint going any where for another 4 years #OBAMA
I wonder if Obama has packed his suitcases if he thinks his lost. Unpack them mate u aint goin nowhere #Obama2012
I wonder how many people didnt notice this happen... Reason why we shouldn't depend so much on technology #election2012 http://metronews.ca/news/world/430403/poll-problems-cropping-up-in-spots-around-us/ …
I wonder if @johnboehner started crying when @BarackObama shed a tear last night #Election2012
I wonder if @allypoppins voted yet? #RomneyRyan2012 💙❤🇺🇸🐘
Wonder what I'll wake up to #election2012

I wonder... who will win? #election2012

@MittRomney why wouldn't you raise the top 3% taxes? They barely pay anything! I'm pretty sure if u raised their taxes they wouldn't notice.
